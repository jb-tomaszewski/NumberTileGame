# Number Tile Game
This is a very simple sliding number puzzle game, created with vanilla JavaScript.  

## How to Run
Simply open the "game.html" file in a web browser.

## How to Play
Click on a tile with a number in it, and if the empty tile is adjacent to it (meaning it is directly above, below, to the left, or to the right), then the two tiles will swap positions.  Keep doing this until all numbers are in order, with the blank tile being the last tile (meaning it is on the bottom-right).
